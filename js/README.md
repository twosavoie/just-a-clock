# A clock

No seriously, it's just a clock. You know how sometimes you have a device that you aren't using any longer, it still works, no one wants it, but you don't want to throw it away? Why not use it as a clock?

There are a few different branches to choose from and I currently don't know which one create a GitHub Pages site for. Currently there are:
* Clock with copyright
* Clock - just a clock
* Clock using a [quote REST API][1] to fetch a quote once/day 

I may make a few others. I think the API could be switched out pretty easily. And I wonder about creating a gist for CS terms. Could be a fun study device! 🤷‍♀️

If you're interested in the process of building this site, you can read [my blog post][2].

Hope you find it helpful. If you do, I would appreciate it if you would leave me a star. ⭐ Stay tuned for updates! 🙂
